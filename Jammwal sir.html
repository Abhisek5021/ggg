           <br><br> <big>Mini Bio (1)</big>
           <br><br> Given his elaborate expertise in the martial arts especially the ancient form called Kalaripayattu (which he's trained in since he was all of 4 years old), Vidyut has committed himself to creating a platform for action and stunts in world cinema. His first Bollywood outing Force (a remake of the Tamil film Kaaka Kaaka) alongside John Abraham gave audiences a sneak peek into the kind of action they can expect from Vidyut. It earned him a clean sweep at the awards that year with him winning all the awards for Most Promising Debut for 2012.
            
            He subsequently played noteworthy roles in the Telugu films Shakti and Oosaravelli, both starring NTR. In 2012,<a href="Jammwal sir.html"><big>Jammwal</big></a> made his debut in Tamil cinema with Billa II, alongside Ajith Kumar. For his role, he received tremendous critical appreciation and was lauded immensely for his action sequences. Post Billa II, he has worked in blockbuster Tamil films like Thuppakki, alongside actor Vijay and Anjaan alongside actor Suriya. Vidyut's performance in Thuppaki earned him a fan following and an award for Best Actor in a Negative Role at SIIMA Awards.
            
            Soon after, he was seen In his next Hindi film Commando, where he showcased some realistic combat based action, all performed and designed by him. With just the trailer launch,<a href="Jammwal sir.html"><big>Vidyut</big></a> created quite a stir and amassed over a million hits within a week of the trailer launch.

            Although the film received a mixed critical reception,<a href="Jammwal sir.html"><big>Jammwal</big></a> and his action earned phenomenal reviews. Noted critic Taran Adarsh mentioned in his review that: "Commando clearly belongs to Vidyut and the liberty of watching him crushing everything and everyone in sight leaves you tongue-tied. By doing the stunts without a body double or cables, he fits into the definition of India's Next Gen action hero without a hitch. He's a fine actor too, although it's the action that takes precedence over histrionics here. Commando was also showcased internationally at the Fantasia Film Fest in Montreal followed by a screening at the Fantastic Fest in Texas in 2013. He received great feedback from international media and well known action directors, calling him India's answer to Bruce Lee and Tony Jaa.
            
            In addition to earning the title of India's New Age Action Hero, the Indian media also went on to tag him as one of the sexiest men they'd seen. He featured in a number of popular lists - Times Most Desirable, Fittest men with Best Bodies and People magazine's Sexiest Men Alive being just a few.
            
            Post Commando, he was seen donning the avatar of a sharpshooter cop in Tigmanshu Dhulia's Bullett Raja and was loved for his action and his performance yet again. Vidyut followed up his on screen magic of Bullett Raja with the sequel of his action franchise Commando and then Milan Luthria's Baadshaho. Known for his gritty and edgy cinematic style, director Tigmanshu Dhulia went on to cast him once again for his next directorial venture: Yaara, a remake of the French film Les Lyonnais, where <a href="Jammwal sir.html"><big>Vidyut</big></a> will be seen in an entirely interesting retro avatar playing the character that ages from 21 to 50. Yaara is set to release early in 2018.
            
            <a href="Jammwal sir.html"><big>Vidyut</big></a> is all set to kick start working on his most exciting project - Junglee directed by American filmmaker Chuck Russell - a name responsible for films like The Scorpion King and The Mask among many others. The film is going to be helmed entirely on<a href="Jammwal sir.html"><big>Vidyut's</big></a> shoulders with a solid focus on showcasing absolutely path-breaking action sequences without cables or body doubles - Vidyut's specialty. He and his very own team of stunt men are said be designing and choreographing all his action sequences for this film.
